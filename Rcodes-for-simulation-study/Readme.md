This folder contains all codes used for the simulation section in my thesis
simulation-scenarios.r: defines all six simulation scenarios used in my thesis, run this first
functions.r: self-defined functions to perform the simulation
functions-bias.r: self-defined functions to calculate average treatment effect estimates as defined in my thesis
functions-BCS.r: self-defined functions to construct the Bayesian credible subgroup
NonE-2blks.r, NonE-3blks.r: perform MC trial simulations under the unenriched group sequential design for 2 blocks and 3 blocks respectively
FC-2blks.r, FC-3blks.r: perform MC trial simulations under the adaptive enrichment design with fixed cutpoints for 2 blocks and 3 blocks respectively
BPP-2blks.r, BPP-3blks.r: perform MC trial simulations under BGSAE design with BPP enrichment strategy for 2 blocks and 3 blocks respectively
BCS-2blks.r, BCS-3blks.r: perform MC trial simulations under BGSAE design with BCS enrichment strategy for 2 blocks and 3 blocks respectively
